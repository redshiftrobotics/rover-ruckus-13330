# 13330

This github repository is on the cloud to allow the 13330 pulsar software engineers to share our code between each other, and make sure we each have the proper version of the code.

* The actual code that you will want to look at is under: 
[13330/TeamCode/src/main/java](https://github.com/redshiftrobotics/13330/tree/master/ftc_app-master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode)
* The contributing guidelines are [Contribution guidelines for this project](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This contains our teleOp, autonomous, and various other files that we need for the robot. Feel free to copy our code! (As long as you give us credit)

You may notice that there are a ton of other files in the repository, you should just ignore those because they are a part of the FTC SDK (software developer kit) which we use to help us write our auto and teleOp.

Thanks for visiting our Repository!
